# Forward-deployed workflows

Operating workflows for forward-deployed roles running the engines inside a real company's pipeline and data stack. The skills catalog covers building a site once; this tier covers operating a deployed content and growth pipeline continuously. Same authoring contract, extended with role, status, connectors, and autonomy.

## Tracks

Three tracks run the pipeline, and a cross-track pair spans them:

- Forward-deployed engineer (FDE): stands the pipeline up and keeps its data and deploys honest.
- Forward-deployed marketer (FDM): runs the content and experimentation loop through prove gates.
- Forward-deployed analyst (FDA): owns the numbers, the attribution, and the diagnosis loops.
- Cross-track: Incident Response and Lane Demotion, and Autonomy Review. These operate over every track, one on the event of a regression and one on a periodic cadence.

## The status ladder

The ladder is this tier's spine. A workflow's status says what has actually happened to it, not how good the document reads.

- template: designed, not executed as written.
- validated: executed as written, by the engines, on a showcase-designated property, with a PUBLIC linked run record; manual runs the workflow merely describes do not count.
- hardened: validated plus failure modes documented from real incidents; explicitly the home of demotion and post_merge_outcome regression data, so hardened is earned by surviving events, not by prose.

Every shipped file below enters at template. Content Pipeline with Prove Gates is the first to flip: Run 1 executed it end to end on a designated property, so its status is validated with the run record linked, the evidence landing before the claim.

## The merge doctrine

Checks report and fail, engines propose and stop, a human merges; autonomy is earned per lane under the published doctrine, never asserted.

## The set

WORKFLOWS.lock is the canonical manifest and the source for any count. The table is the list. Shipped files link, and with this wave every file is shipped, so no row remains defined and publishing.

## Roadmap: named, not launched

- AI-Surface Visibility Baseline (FDM): fails connector readiness honestly; ships when citation-measurement has real runs.
- Attribution and Outcome Reporting (FDA): fails honest usability at template status; ships when the agreement log has real cross-property rows and post_merge_outcome data.
- Forward-deployed product manager track (FDPM): named to hold the track; not launched, and carried with the same visible not-launched treatment so it cannot read as an empty shipped track.

## The docs in this tier

- CONNECTORS.md: the capability classes every workflow declares, the deliberate absences, and the operated-substrate boundary.
- AGREEMENT-LOG.md: the public schema for the agreement log the operated deployment writes, generalized from the canonical agreement-rate table.
