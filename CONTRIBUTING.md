# Contributing to Brand Build Skills for Claude

Thank you for considering a contribution. This library is opinionated by design: every skill follows the same structure, the same voice, and the same authoring conventions. That uniformity is what makes the skills compose cleanly. Contributions that respect those conventions are welcome.

If you have not read [SKILL_AUTHORING.md](SKILL_AUTHORING.md), start there. It is the source of truth for the skill structure and the bar for shipping.

---

## What we accept

- **New skills** that fill a real gap in the lifecycle and follow the uniform structure
- **Reference file improvements** to existing skills (better templates, deeper checklists, worked examples)
- **Bug fixes** in cross-references, broken internal links, typos, or stale information
- **Clarifications** to existing skills that improve trigger reliability or output quality

## What we will likely decline

- Stack-specific skills that hard-code one framework (Next.js-only, WordPress-only). The library is stack-agnostic by policy.
- Skills that duplicate an existing skill in scope. Check the catalog first.
- Skills that depend on a specific commercial tool, with the single exception of the SEO audit suite which depends on the Ahrefs MCP. New tool-bound skills need a strong justification.
- Marketing or promotional content disguised as a skill.
- Additions to the README MCP shortlist that a maintainer has not used and vouched for. See **Recommending an MCP server** below.

## Recommending an MCP server

The README keeps a short, curated list of MCP servers grouped by lifecycle phase. It points builders at tools the maintainers have used on real site work and will put the catalog's name behind. It is a recommendation, not a directory, and it stays short on purpose.

The bar reflects what this catalog is for. RampStack is a framework for original creation: building the brands, sites, and content that did not exist before you built them. The tools we recommend serve that work, and they have to be safe to hand to a real business, from a one-person shop to an enterprise team. Much of the AI tooling built around scraping, data copying, and platform automation attracts bad actors and carries legal and reputational risk, so we keep it out. That keeps the catalog something a serious business can adopt without a second thought.

What that means in practice:

- **It has to sit inside the website lifecycle this catalog covers** (research, brand, design, content, SEO, dev, ops, growth). Tools whose core job is scraping, bulk data extraction, or off-platform automation are out of scope, even the well engineered ones.
- **A maintainer has to have used it** on a real build and be willing to vouch for it. We do not list tools we have only read about.
- **Vendors do not add their own tools.** If you build or work on an MCP server, you are welcome to suggest it, but disclose the affiliation and expect it to clear the same bar as everything else. Self-submitted vendor PRs that add a product to the list will be closed with a link to this section.
- **The list recommends capabilities, not links.** Anything that reads as placement for traffic, backlinks, or customer acquisition gets declined.

If you think a tool belongs on the list, open a thread in [Discussions](https://github.com/rampstackco/claude-skills/discussions) with the tool and a concrete use case you hit on a real project. Direct PRs that edit the MCP list will generally be closed in favor of that thread.

## Quick contribution steps

1. **Open an issue first** for any new skill or major change. This prevents wasted effort.
2. **Fork the repo.**
3. **Create a feature branch.** Name it descriptively: `add-skill-form-strategy`, `fix-broken-link-in-seo-keyword`, etc.
4. **Follow the uniform structure** documented in [SKILL_AUTHORING.md](SKILL_AUTHORING.md).
5. **Run the contributor checklist** below.
6. **Submit a PR** with a clear title, description, and link to the originating issue.

## Adding a new skill

The README catalog section is generated from skill folder metadata. Do not hand-edit it.

1. Create the skill folder at `skills/your-skill-name/`.
2. Author `SKILL.md` with these YAML frontmatter fields:
   - `name` (string, must match folder name)
   - `description` (string, 2 to 4 sentences with triggers)
   - `category` (one of: `strategy-and-discovery`, `brand`, `design`, `content`, `seo-foundation`, `seo-audit-suite`, `product`, `development`, `qa`, `operations`, `growth`, `research`, `cross-cutting`, `process-and-team`)
   - `catalog_summary` (string, one-line description for the catalog table)
   - `display_order` (integer, controls position within the category; omit for alphabetical-by-slug)
3. Add at least one reference file under `skills/your-skill-name/references/`.
4. Run `python scripts/generate_readme_catalog.py --write`. The generator updates the badge, subtitle, "What you get" counts, table-of-contents anchor, catalog header, and the catalog table.
5. Verify with `python .github/scripts/lint_skills.py`.
6. Open the PR.

The catalog content between `<!-- CATALOG:START -->` and `<!-- CATALOG:END -->` (and the six smaller marker pairs) is owned by the generator. Hand edits inside markers are overwritten on the next run. The generator is the source of truth.

## Skill structure (the short version)

```
your-skill-name/
  SKILL.md
  references/
    template.md
    checklist.md
    example.md
```

Your `SKILL.md` must include these sections, in this exact order:

1. YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
2. One-paragraph purpose statement
3. `## When to use`
4. `## When NOT to use`
5. `## Required inputs`
6. `## The framework`
7. `## Workflow`
8. `## Failure patterns`
9. `## Output format`
10. `## Reference files`

The full spec, with examples and rationale, lives in [SKILL_AUTHORING.md](SKILL_AUTHORING.md). The fastest path to writing a compliant skill is to use the [`skill-creation-walkthrough`](skills/skill-creation-walkthrough/SKILL.md) skill itself.

## Voice and style

The library has a specific voice. Match it.

- **Punchy short sentences.** Avoid run-ons.
- **No em dashes.** Use periods, colons, parentheses, or commas.
- **No first-person.** Neutral instructional voice.
- **Concrete examples beat abstract advice.** Failure patterns should name the mistake specifically, not generically.
- **Stack-agnostic.** Never hard-code framework versions in SKILL.md. Move stack-specific patterns to reference files if absolutely needed.
- **No emojis** unless the skill is explicitly about content where they fit (and even then, sparingly).
- **No private brand or company references.** Skills are public, so they should be generic.

## Contributor checklist

Before opening a PR, verify all of the following:

- [ ] Skill folder name is `lowercase-hyphenated`
- [ ] `SKILL.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] `name` in frontmatter matches the folder name exactly
- [ ] `description` is 2-4 sentences with explicit triggers and an "Also triggers when..." line
- [ ] All 10 sections are present in the documented order
- [ ] At least one reference file exists in `references/`
- [ ] Reference files in the SKILL.md "Reference files" section match the actual files
- [ ] No em dashes anywhere (search files for U+2014)
- [ ] No vendor-specific framework references in the SKILL.md body
- [ ] No version-specific references (e.g., "Tailwind 4", "Next.js 15") in the SKILL.md body
- [ ] No private brand, personal handle, or proprietary domain references
- [ ] Cross-references to sibling skills name skills that actually exist
- [ ] `SKILL.md` is under 250 lines (hard cap 500)
- [ ] Each reference file is under 400 lines
- [ ] You have read at least one existing skill in a similar category and matched its style
- [ ] If you added a new skill, the new SKILL.md frontmatter has `category`, `catalog_summary`, and `display_order` fields, and `python scripts/generate_readme_catalog.py --write` was run to update the README catalog
- [ ] If you added a new skill, you ran a quick local search for trigger collisions with existing skills

## Pull request guidelines

- **One concept per PR.** Do not bundle a new skill, three bug fixes, and a refactor. Split them.
- **Clear PR title.** Format: `Add: [skill-name]`, `Fix: [short description]`, `Improve: [skill-name] reference file`.
- **Description includes:**
  - Link to the originating issue
  - What the contribution adds or changes
  - Why it earns its place (especially for new skills)
  - Any decisions you made that future maintainers should know about
- **Be patient.** This is a maintained library. Reviews take time.
- **Be open to feedback.** The reviewer's goal is uniformity and quality, not gatekeeping.

---

## Reviewing process

1. A maintainer reviews the PR for structural compliance, voice match, and substance.
2. Comments may be left for clarification or required changes.
3. Once approved, the PR is merged.
4. CI runs the lint suite on every PR, including the generator-sync check. Stale README catalog blocks the merge.

---

## Security and review requirements

Every skill, whether authored in-house or contributed, is held to the same
review standard before it merges.

### All contributions

- Follow [SKILL_AUTHORING.md](SKILL_AUTHORING.md) for SKILL.md structure and
  metadata.
- Commits to `main` are signed and merged through a pull request with linear
  history.
- Each skill and its bundled files must pass the safety checklist below.
- PRs are squash-merged.

### Safety checklist

Unless the behavior is the skill's explicit, documented purpose, a skill must
not:

- Make network calls or reference external domains from bundled scripts.
- Read environment variables, credentials, or secret files.
- Spawn shells or subprocesses.
- Contain instructions that redirect Claude away from the user's task.
- Use trigger conditions broader than the skill's actual scope.
- Write to agent memory or persistence files.

Anything that legitimately needs one of these must declare it in the PR and
gets extra review. An advisory scan (`tools/scan_skills.py`) flags these
patterns to focus review; it is a guide, not a gate.

### When external contributions are open (curator mode)

These apply once the catalog accepts outside contributors:

- Sign off each commit under the Developer Certificate of Origin
  (`git commit -s`).
- Complete the PR template, declaring what the skill does and what it accesses.
- The scan is promoted to a required status check.
- Skills carrying executable code get two-person review.

## Code of conduct

Be respectful. Be constructive. Disagree on substance, not personality. Bad-faith contributions, harassment, or self-promotional spam will be closed without comment.
